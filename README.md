# Hamster-Watch

This is a small project to make my hamsters world visible in the world wide net. 

- webcam
- counting of wheel-meters and -times
- snapshots of my hamster walking in the wheel
- measuring temperature and humidity in the hamsters world

My hamster is living in a box of approximately 80x60 cm and is active in the night.
